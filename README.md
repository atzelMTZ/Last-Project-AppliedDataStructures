Hey! This is a pygame project, with the main objective to identify and use the Applied Data Structures terms. This is a basic car game, where the car moves by pressing the arroy keys (LEFT and RIGHT) to dodge the other vehicles and avoid crashing. Every 5 dodged cars, the game becomes more difficult by increasing the speed.
